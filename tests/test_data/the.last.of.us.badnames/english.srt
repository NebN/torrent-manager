00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,790
DAVID PAULIDES: How do you 
put this behind you 
and move forward?

2
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:27,026
That's something I ask 
each missing person family

3
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,496
because I don't understand 
how you can do that.

4
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,297
-I can't. 
-Yeah.

5
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,834
I mean, you know, 
I want some type of closure.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,669
I want him to be found.

7
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,841
DAVID: 
One of the most 
confusing and frustrating

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,309
investigations 
by law enforcement

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,078
is related to people 
who disappear

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,147
in highly rural locations,

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,351
forests, plains, 
deserts and regions 
with few residences.

12
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,287
These cases 
offer no witnesses,

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,724
few clues 
and a strange lack of 
evidence.

14
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,225
Where are these people?

15
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,828
How did they disappear 
without leaving a scent trail,

16
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,632
no tracks 
and a distinct 
lack of physical evidence.

17
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,801
The investigators left 
with the distraught family

18
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,204
grieving about a missing 
loved one, wanting them found,

19
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,039
where many times 
the search area

20
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,841
is the size 
of a national forest.

21
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,644
My name is David Paulides.

22
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,679
I'm a former 
San Jose police officer

23
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,649
who has worked with complex 
and long term investigations,

24
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,251
while being assigned 
to Vice & Intelligence,

25
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,721
street crimes, SWAT, 
and various detective roles.

26
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm a bestselling author,

27
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,693
investigating missing people 
in national parks, forests

28
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,529
and rural locations 
for over 20 years.

29
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,698
The investigative process 
has led me to interview

30
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,167
incredible witnesses 
that tell a fantastic story

31
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,436
that challenges 
the investigative protocols

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,271
every detective follows.

33
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,041
We are staring 
at unconventional 
possibilities

34
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,776
supported by witnesses, video

35
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,312
and most recently, 
our own government.

36
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,388
The human species 
has been watching the Earth 
for thousands of years.

37
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,524
Hunting, gathering 
and observing.

38
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,794
From the moment 
we left our cave,

39
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,128
we have looked to the skies

40
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,296
in amazement and wonder

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,432
about unidentified objects.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,535
MAN 1: Are you recording?

43
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,605
MAN 2: What's that?

44
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,807
DAVID: 
In just 
the last 100-plus years,

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,009
we have left the ground 
and flown into the clouds

46
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,845
with a different perspective 
about our life in this world.

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,986
DAVID: We've 
continued to be amazed 
and perplexed by flying 
objects

48
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,787
that have capabilities 
far beyond

49
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,156
what our government 
says is ours.

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,225
Are these crafts 
piloted by entities

51
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,727
that have our best interests?

52
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,531
Is our planet 
merely the ant farm

53
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,233
for complex societies 
light years from Earth?

54
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,704
Could it be we offer 
other worlds new DNA

55
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,008
that's needed to refurbish 
their existence?

56
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,846
Or are they driven by a plan 
that is so far beyond 
our capability to comprehend

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,515
that the human mind 
isn't programmed to accept

58
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,651
and live with 
the consequences?

59
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,819
Join me 
on a fact finding journey

60
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,288
that has never been disclosed.

61
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,390
Keep an open mind 
on the possibilities

62
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,191
and a warm 
and compassionate heart

63
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,493
for the missing.

64
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,933
GEORGE KNAPP: 
In multiple 
Missing 411 
books,

65
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,670
it looks like people 
are snatched out of 
off the ground

66
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,838
and then some of them 
are dropped back

67
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,340
into these locations.

68
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,275
The little kids 
that are suddenly,

69
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,944
miles and miles away.

70
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,646
It seems like, I know 
you don't want to commit

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,150
to any particular explanation

72
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:41,387
because you don't 
have enough evidence to 
to point at one in particular.

73
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,922
But some of this stuff

74
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,192
certainly ventures 
into the area of the 
paranormal

75
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,428
and, uh, and one 
of the stories

76
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,431
that I was able to 
break earlier this year 
was about Skinwalker Ranch,

77
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:55,535
that, a program that had been 
created by the Pentagon

78
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,204
uh, to look at UFOs

79
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,174
also went much further 
than it studied,

80
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,644
we would call 
paranormal events, 
unexplained mysteries

81
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,447
at places like 
Skinwalker Ranch 
and elsewhere.

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,749
And earlier this year 
I was invited to go back

83
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,753
by Senator Harry Reid 
to meet with two people 
whose names I cannot,

84
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,688
cannot make public.

85
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,957
One of these guys 
pulls me aside

86
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,759
and then he said,

87
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,861
"You know, we think 
that that guy David Paulides

88
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,765
"that uh, that his mystery 
with these missing people

89
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,134
"might be related 
to the phenomenon 
at the ranch."

90
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,903
But the idea that 
the phenomena

91
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,205
that's been seen there,

92
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,073
which is sometimes playful

93
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,541
and sometimes dangerous,

94
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,378
might be related 
to yours, startled me.

95
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,213
And I don't know 
how you react to that,

96
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,682
but maybe 
it makes you uncomfortable

97
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,418
uh, being associated 
with anything as weird as 
that,

98
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,020
but your stuff's 
pretty weird, too.

99
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,388
[RECORDER CLICK OFF]

100
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,427
DAVID: 
So after reviewing 
several thousand 
missing person cases,

101
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,697
several distinct facts 
started to come up.

102
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,700
And I started to put 
piles of these reports

103
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,435
in different areas 
of my room

104
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:07,140
that indicated 
certain points of importance.

105
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,842
And after a while I started 
to call these, "profile 
points".

106
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:15,381
As an example, in 97% 
of the cases that I research,

107
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,716
one of the profile points,

108
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,185
is that canines 
brought to the scene

109
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,688
can't pick up a scent trail.

110
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,692
They bring trackers 
to the scene 
and they can't find tracks

111
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,728
leaving the location 
that the person 
was last seen at.

112
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,730
So the number 
one profile point

113
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,366
in our work 
is lack of scent trail.

114
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,535
Some of the most 
common profile points

115
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,603
would be 
weather related issues,

116
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,939
either just as 
the person disappears

117
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,141
or just after they're, 
they're missing,

118
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,012
or when the search starts, 
there's a weather incident

119
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,750
that inhibits 
the searchers ability 
to find the individual.

120
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,153
Another one is 
the victim's found in an area

121
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,988
that was previously searched.

122
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,958
Oftentimes an area 
will be searched

123
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,027
five, six, seven times,

124
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,396
and then all of a sudden 
when they're getting 
ready to pull out,

125
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,198
the search and rescue 
says we give up,

126
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,867
they find the person 
in the middle of the area

127
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,003
that had been searched 
many, many times.

128
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,772
Oftentimes when 
somebody goes missing,

129
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,575
they go missing 
in an area near water,

130
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,678
or boulders or 
swamps and bogs.

131
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,748
And once 
these profile points 
were established,

132
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,985
and this is after reading 
thousands of reports, 
I started to document them.

133
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:29,756
And say, "Okay, if these 
are gonna be the profile 
points

134
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,158
"that we use moving forward, 
then these will be the ones

135
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,927
"that we have to look for 
in the reports 
as they come in."

136
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,432
This has become 
the overshadowing criteria

137
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,501
for a Missing 411 case.

138
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,837
And in this instance

139
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,973
we're in Vancouver, 
British Columbia,

140
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,109
and we are researching 
a case of a missing hunter,

141
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,613
someone who had visited 
the same location,

142
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,948
20 times in 20 years.

143
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,951
It's a location 
that he and his wife 
have come to many times.

144
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,288
In this instance, 
he came out alone.

145
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,924
He brought his dogs, 
his camper,

146
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,493
and his raft, 
to do a little fishing,

147
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,797
sightseeing 
and just relaxing in nature.

148
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,034
And he disappeared 
on the shores of Harrison 
Lake.

149
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,138
And we still don't know 
what really happened 
to Ray Salmen.

150
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,508
DANIELA SALMEN: 
Ray 
was an outdoor 
camper-hunter-fisherman.

151
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,077
Grew up in the woods, 
northern Ontario.

152
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,116
Uh, very experienced 
and a safe outdoorsman.

153
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,984
Thirty-two years, 
we were married together.

154
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,020
For about 
a year-and-a-half 
before that,

155
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,689
he would have rather gone 
hunting, camping with me

156
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,690
than with anyone else.

157
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,925
He was always telling me that.

158
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,060
But I am a fair 
weather camper.

159
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,962
I would not have been 
out in the bush

160
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,798
if it wasn't for Ray, 
Ray made it wonderful.

161
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,170
JOHN MILES: 
At the time 
I met him, he was about 65.

162
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,373
Just recently retired.

163
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,676
He worked 
for Rogers Sugar in Vancouver

164
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,946
as chief maintenance man.

165
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,915
He was empathetic. 
He was concerned about

166
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,587
what you felt about something, 
which is rare today.

167
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,623
And I liked that, 
I enjoyed his company.

168
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,559
He is the type of guy 
who is from the old school.

169
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,261
He had this 
adventurous spirit.

170
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,398
He had a map of British 
Columbia in a booklet form.

171
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,835
Very seldom would I find 
a blank page

172
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,639
part of this province 
that Ray hadn't visited.

173
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,181
DAVID: 
So he drove 
up to Harrison Lake

174
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,850
-from your home here. 
-DANIELA: 
Right.

175
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,453
DAVID: 
In a truck 
with a camper? 
DANIELA: 
Right.

176
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,889
And what else 
did he have with him?

177
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,492
DANIELA: 
A fridge, a furnace, 
air conditioner, a few rifles

178
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,461
and maybe 
a couple of pistols with him.

179
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,998
And he took his Zodiac with 
him and a motor on the 
Zodiac.

180
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,468
He had a complete life jacket. 
Good flotation device.

181
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,736
So fully equipped.

182
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,271
He had the two dogs,

183
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,740
and if anything comes around, 
they would bark.

184
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,775
DAVID: 
He'd been to the spot 
many times before?

185
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,211
DANIELA: 
Many times 
because you can get there,

186
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,780
when he was still working, 
he could go a Friday after 
work

187
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,082
and get there and set up camp

188
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,084
and I've been with him 
a couple of times.

189
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,387
We've gone 
for a week at a time.

190
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,722
DAVID: 
And again 
for clarity, he doesn't go

191
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,225
-and just sit 
at his camper all day? 
-No.

192
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,628
DAVID: 
He's out 
going over the hillsides, 
walking around.

193
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,732
So he's been all through 
the mountain sides in this 
area

194
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,935
-many times in the past. 
-Correct.

195
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,003
JOHN: 
He says, "Oh, yeah, 
I'm gonna camp down

196
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,506
"by the lake 
in this certain spot."

197
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,207
So he says, 
"I gotta get going now

198
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,643
"because I've got to 
set up camp before dark."

199
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,078
That's the last time 
I've seen him.

200
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,416
We were planning 
to go out of the lake

201
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,218
and look for old gold mines.

202
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,856
He says, "I'll come down 
in the Zodiac and pick you up 
on Monday morning."

203
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,994
On Sunday afternoon, 
I was doing some repair work

204
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,364
on a trailer up here 
and we heard three gunshots.

205
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,001
[GUNSHOTS]

206
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:07,039
Home alone downstairs, 
watching TV 
and the doorbell rings.

207
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,675
And it was 
a Vancouver City police 
officer,

208
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,545
and she was asking 
if Ray Salmen is home.

209
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,947
So I went, "What is it? 
What's wrong? 
Why are you asking me this?"

210
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,751
And she said she didn't 
have any information,

211
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,186
and I couldn't contact Ray

212
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,587
even though 
he had a cell phone.

213
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,024
There isn't any, uh, 
cell phone coverage 
at Harrison Lake.

214
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,760
I think I phoned the RCMP 
at about five in the morning

215
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,295
and they were very brief.

216
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,564
They never gave me 
any details at the time.

217
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,733
They just said he is missing.

218
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,134
So I didn't know if he was

219
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,604
walking with the dogs 
somewhere and didn't make it 
back.

220
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,107
And as he said to me,

221
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,609
"If you're injured, 
if you're in the woods 
and you're injured,

222
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,478
"you wait for them 
to come to you.

223
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,781
"Don't start trying 
to crawl around 
wasting energy if you can't.

224
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,216
"They will come 
and they will look for you."

225
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,685
And I thought, "Okay, 
I know what's happened now."

226
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,722
ADAM PALMER: 
A call came in 
about going out to search

227
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,659
for a possible missing person 
at this spot.

228
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,163
The team knew, I was 
actually, I had a lot of 
experience in this area.

229
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,998
So I was one 
of the first team members

230
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,566
to arrive 
at that scene that day.

231
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,636
When we showed up, 
his truck and camper 
were right at this very spot.

232
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,839
All his belongings 
were kind of laid out 
under the tarp.

233
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,641
His truck and camper 
looked in great shape.

234
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:20,012
The RCMP goes up, 
they find the truck 
and the camper locked.

235
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,216
Dogs inside, two dogs, 
and nobody is around.

236
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,520
If Ray went out for a hike,

237
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,555
-would he take the dogs? 
-Definitely.

238
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,124
-So he wouldn't leave them in? 
-Never leave the dogs in.

239
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,293
This is what he's got 
the dogs for.

240
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,830
So in your mind, why would 
he lock the camper door?

241
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,100
Unless there 
was a danger to the dogs.

242
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,370
But what kind of danger 
would be there to the dogs.

243
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,505
ADAM: 
It was 
the strangest thing.

244
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,809
I've never 
showed up to a search 
where we had full E.R.T 
members

245
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,311
and there was guys 
with fully automatic weapons

246
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,213
and I remember it 
very specifically

247
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,681
because I've never 
showed up to a search

248
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,149
where we're 
searching alongside

249
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,285
the Emergency 
Response Team members.

250
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,055
I was with the RCMP 
for 31 years,

251
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,425
and back here 
where I'm from, 
in the Fraser Valley,

252
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,894
I was here for 22 years.

253
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,362
DAVID: Are you familiar 
with the Ray Salmen

254
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,832
-disappearance on Harrison 
Lake? -Yes.

255
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:17,536
DAVID: 
So on 
a disappearance of a, 
a missing person case,

256
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,873
can you fathom in your own 
mind why they would send out

257
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,409
an RCMP SWAT team?

258
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,077
For the unanswered questions.

259
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,913
Are we looking at someone 
who got murdered?

260
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,416
Are we looking at somebody 
who got kidnapped?

261
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,253
Or they may have a tip 
that nobody knows about.

262
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,922
I don't know about, 
top-secret kind of stuff.

263
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,791
I remember 
an officer telling me,

264
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,727
kids showed up 
at the Agassiz RCMP 
detachment,

265
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,864
saying that 
their vehicle was shot at.

266
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,299
And I remember later 
talking to the RCMP officer

267
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,969
saying that kids 
reported their headlights 
being shot out.

268
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,038
If he shot out 
somebody's headlights,

269
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,176
and he was that good of a shot 
to shoot out the headlights,

270
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,545
then he was probably trying

271
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,815
to get attention 
to where he was?

272
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,216
I don't know if I would shoot

273
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,684
at someone's car 
to get attention,

274
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,319
because what's going 
in my mind is,

275
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,955
"Oh, my God, what if 
I accidentally hit someone?"

276
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,158
Now we know Ray 
was a responsible hunter,

277
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,293
had a license to 
have his guns,

278
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,229
had hunted for decades, 
so, yeah, I am with you.

279
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,832
I believe that, 
that is very strange behavior.

280
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,434
I remember thinking, "Well 
that, that wouldn't have been 
Ray."

281
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,403
Ray wouldn't be shooting, 
if he did anything,

282
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,673
as he told me, "You shoot 
three times in the air for 
SOS."

283
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,977
Now, there is more to the 
story than just Ray missing.

284
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,513
But not knowing what.

285
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,116
Right directly behind him 
was the grad party.

286
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,685
So the party was 
happening up over here.

287
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,687
There was estimated to be 
above 50,

288
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,589
50 people at that party, 
and there was

289
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,825
a massive amount of garbage 
we cleaned up when we got 
here.

290
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:51,463
And they didn't consider 
that possible evidence as 
well?

291
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,400
Something seemed wrong, 
um, at that point.

292
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,303
DAVID: 
When you hear 
the search and rescue persons

293
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,572
rendition of 
what just happened,

294
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,176
I don't think in 7,000 cases

295
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,379
that I've ever heard 
anything so strange

296
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,617
as telling a search 
and rescue group 
to go pick up a grad party's

297
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,352
remains of what they left

298
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,421
and then, 
coupled with the fact that

299
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,424
there were shots 
fired at the scene

300
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:22,895
and they bring in 
a special weapons team 
to the area.

301
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,465
But that wasn't it.

302
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,568
The more you hear, 
the stranger this story gets.

303
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,738
ADAM: 
We would hike 
for a couple hours in here 
and start grid searching,

304
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:37,243
and we would 
just basically come back 
to this point then go again.

305
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,279
Then we also got on ATVs, 
and so we had boats.

306
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,315
We had two watercraft 
in the lake at that time,

307
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,018
searching the shoreline, 
air support as well.

308
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,453
DAVID: And I remember 
when I first talked to you,

309
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,355
you said you were told 
not to go into the bush?

310
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,656
On the second day,

311
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,758
his belongings 
were found by air.

312
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,693
They spotted his clothes.

313
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,462
Now, this is a day,

314
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,497
if not two days 
after the initial search.

315
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,333
It wasn't even probably 
an hour or two after that,

316
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:06,338
I remember the corporal, 
the RCMP members, 
still in uniform,

317
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,109
coming out of the bush, 
saying it's unsearchable.

318
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,178
We found his, his clothes.

319
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,347
Um, it's not 
worth it to go in there.

320
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,083
It's so clear 
because I was like, 
"Nothing is unsearchable."

321
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,753
Why would they all of a sudden 
just call it that quickly?

322
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,657
DAVID: 
I asked Adam 
to show me the location 
where Ray's clothes were 
found.

323
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,993
Strangely, there 
was even a worn out

324
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,562
search and rescue tag 
on a tree.

325
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,199
ADAM: This is where his 
clothes were probably most 
likely found.

326
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:38,003
It's very old. 
It's, yeah, that would be 
from that time period.

327
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,374
DAVID: 
The search 
uncovered via helicopter

328
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,344
some folded items 
under a log,

329
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,248
and his rifle 400 yards 
north of his truck,

330
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,383
right on the beach.

331
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:56,155
And then over a small hill 
quite a distance away,

332
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,424
they found his pistol 
laying in a meadow.

333
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,959
DANIELA: 
They would, 
they would give me 
bits and pieces.

334
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,328
They would call, 
they would say,

335
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,430
"Oh, we found Ray's 
backpack under a tree."

336
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,398
And then later 
on they told me,

337
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,335
somewhere in a field 
they found his nine 
-millimeter.

338
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:14,173
And I thought Ray would never 
leave a pistol anywhere.

339
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,210
So you're into it a few days, 
they found these items,

340
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:22,614
uh, I read that it was 
the feeling of the RCMP 
that he must be in the water.

341
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,416
Is that true?

342
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,487
As they were saying, 
"Oh, we think 
he must have drowned,"

343
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,989
and I thought, "Well, 
that doesn't make any sense."

344
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,392
His boat is at the campsite,

345
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,993
so he wouldn't 
have fallen off the boat.

346
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,295
And if he was on the boat,

347
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,797
he would have had 
his life jacket on.

348
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,065
The official report says,

349
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,368
he was injured 
and got into the water

350
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,703
and was trying to swim back, 
and that's how he drowned.

351
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,739
But it was hard to believe.

352
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,208
DAVID: If anybody said, "Well, 
he was stripping his clothes

353
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,542
because he had hypothermia"?

354
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,911
It wasn't raining 
and it was June.

355
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,146
It was, it was warm

356
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,916
and I was even up 
at 6,000-feet elevation,

357
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,885
and I was 
in a T-shirt, sweating.

358
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:00,886
DANIELA: 
They never found

359
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,323
any traces of any blood, 
animal or human.

360
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,624
They even said 
it was unusual

361
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,293
that they had 
that many tracking dogs

362
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,162
and never found a track.

363
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,231
DAVID: 
Or a scent? 
DANIELA: 
Or a scent.

364
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,700
DAVID: 
That's 
an important point.

365
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,302
When you go 
from the point of the pistol,

366
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,207
from the camper to the beach,

367
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:28,380
you have an established area 
to start from, to go to.

368
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,482
It's not like you're going 
blindly at this point.

369
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,351
So the dogs 
should have been able

370
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,821
to track Ray 
point-to-point-to-point 
pretty easily,

371
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,423
and they didn't.

372
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,326
The RCMP had a search boat, 
combing the shoreline.

373
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,997
Ray's wife also hired 
a private response team

374
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,266
to come in 
and also search the area.

375
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,101
No body was ever recovered.

376
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,737
So Daniela went out 
with the search boat

377
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,407
and actually spent 
hours on scene 
looking for her husband.

378
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,942
I had arranged 
with the Ralston's

379
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,545
to come down 
and search for Ray.

380
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,246
DAVID: 
Daniela told us 
from the beginning

381
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,616
that she thought 
that the RCMP was pushing

382
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,020
this probability 
that Ray was in the water.

383
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,855
And talking to 
search and rescue people

384
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,325
they didn't necessarily 
believe Ray was in the water.

385
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,927
And I'm not sure 
if you guys were aware,

386
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,363
but they found his pistol 
on top of a mountain,

387
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,666
not even anywhere 
near the water.

388
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,402
-And Daniela said 
there is no way... 
- 
{end-italic} GENE RALSTON: 
Yeah.

389
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,237
-...Ray would 
lose such a pistol. 
-Yeah.

390
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,573
-Had you heard that? 
-We hadn't heard that, no.

391
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,641
So it's interesting. 
Initially, I don't think

392
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:34,480
they wanted to give me back 
his, um, guns and rifles.

393
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,914
DAVID: 
What about 
the backpack?

394
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,316
No, I didn't get that back.

395
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,618
DAVID: 
Don't you 
think that's odd?

396
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,290
They weren't there 
to explain themselves to me.

397
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,794
DAVID: Ever be a reason 
to lie to the victim family?

398
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,397
No, not from police, no.

399
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,868
-Ever? 
-No, never.

400
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,037
DAVID: 
It became 
blatantly obvious

401
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,774
that the RCMP was withholding 
information from Daniela.

402
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,143
Files obtained through 
the Freedom of Information Act

403
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,246
turned up 
blacked out paragraphs.

404
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,014
I have encountered 
similar issues

405
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,482
through 
the Freedom of Information Act

406
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,117
and the release of details.

407
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,587
Some of the off-the-record 
interviews that we were doing,

408
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,357
alluded to a connection 
to some of the local legends

409
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,759
and bizarre sightings 
within this area.

410
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,896
People that go missing 
or these things that happen 
that don't quite make sense.

411
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,497
It happens in an area where

412
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,633
a lot of time, 
there's gold 
or there's a history.

413
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,268
There's a legacy. 
There's legends.

414
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,336
There are stories 
of past occurrences.

415
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,472
There's a reason why 
they're called sky ancestors.

416
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:38,777
DAVID: We heard that the RCMP 
has a policy about UFOs?

417
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,878
Yes.

418
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,547
Tell us about that.

419
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,583
If you get involved 
with the UFO investigation,

420
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,219
it is, you hand 
that information over.

421
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,987
I don't know where it goes.

422
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,656
-So somebody somewhere... 
-Yeah.

423
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,358
...is collecting 
and tracking this information?

424
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,994
I would say so. Yes. 
You have to.

425
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,530
You cannot let that stuff go.

426
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,533
-And they take it seriously? 
-Yep. Yeah.

427
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,235
That information is collected,

428
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,272
and wherever it goes 
into some secret something.

429
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:13,078
So during the interview 
with the RCMP officer 
that was retired,

430
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,880
yeah, it reminded me

431
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,816
of a document that I saw 
several years ago.

432
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,851
In March of 1960,

433
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,487
the RCMP had a document

434
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,856
that would have been 
classified as restricted,

435
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,026
that had to do with 
the Athabaskan Indians,

436
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,332
seeing a UFO in the general 
area of where Ray Salmen 
disappeared.

437
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,137
And that document in essence, 
says that they saw something

438
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,673
that we would consider today

439
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,443
to be your 
standard cylindrical UFO.

440
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,816
DANIELA: 
We were 
camping once at a place 
called Fire Lake,

441
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,218
and we were just sitting 
around the campfire in the 
evening

442
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:57,055
and there is a large lake, 
and on the other side 
there's a mountain.

443
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,025
And there wasn't any logging 
going on at that mountain

444
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,662
and we were sitting there 
and we could see 
a light across the lake.

445
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:07,933
I said, "Oh, there must be 
logging going on there. 
It looks like there's a car."

446
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,735
And Ray said, 
"That's not a car," 
and he goes,

447
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,404
"I know for a fact there isn't 
any logging going there."

448
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,306
He knows all the roads, 
all the back hills.

449
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,841
He's hiked everywhere.

450
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,210
But as we're looking 
at this light,

451
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,811
it's traveling very quickly

452
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,314
and doing 90 degree turns, 
very unusual.

453
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,550
So a car in the mountains 
wouldn't have been 
traveling that way.

454
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,085
And it wasn't just a flash.

455
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,054
We were sitting there 
watching this.

456
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,991
And I remember sitting there 
for a good ten minutes

457
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,527
watching this 
and almost enjoying this.

458
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,162
I thought, 
"This is fascinating."

459
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,698
You ever seen anything strange 
in the skies out here?

460
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,135
Well, I've been 
here a long time.

461
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,204
When I had 
the cottage over there, 
I had some friends

462
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,241
and he came up 
with his girlfriend.

463
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,376
And they camped on the beach.

464
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,346
I guess it was about 
2:30 in the morning.

465
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,981
They were in the tent, 
on the beach

466
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,251
in the middle of the night, 
asleep. My friend said,

467
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,054
"I was sleeping like that, 
and all of a sudden 
I knew there was a light.

468
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,722
"It woke me up.

469
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,759
"And the inside of the tent 
it was like daylight."

470
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,996
He unzipped the door 
and looks outside,

471
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:15,100
and it was like 
the 12 o'clock high noon,

472
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,835
on the clearest 
day of the year,

473
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,804
and he could see 
the beach and the water

474
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,806
and all that for 
but he couldn't see past

475
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,775
a certain area 
so it was lit up.

476
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,180
And that clicked, 
you know?

477
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,649
Hey, I believe 
what they told me

478
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,851
because somebody else 
told me the same thing.

479
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,022
As an investigator 
who has a very open mind,

480
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,891
and absorbs all the details,

481
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,729
no matter 
how outlandish and strange,

482
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,531
I really have to put 
some parameters up sometimes

483
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,634
about how far down 
the rabbit hole I'll go.

484
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:55,173
Considering this 
I'd a good friend 
in the state of Washington

485
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,176
that is really a UFO expert.

486
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,711
And I wanna take it to him.

487
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,279
My name is Peter Davenport.

488
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,014
I'm, for the last 26 years

489
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,785
I've been the director of the 
National UFO Reporting Center

490
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,855
and that's what I do. 
I'm a UFO investigator.

491
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,324
What is the difference 
between MUFON

492
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,892
and what you do 
in your organization?

493
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,694
Well, they're two 
separate organizations.

494
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,996
MUFON is an older 
organization.

495
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,266
And MUFON is more 
of an investigative body.

496
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,902
It's a membership 
organization.

497
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,271
The National UFO 
Reporting Center

498
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,640
has one member, and that is I.

499
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,076
Do you ever investigate 
any of the reports you get?

500
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,544
Yeah, once in a while.

501
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,713
I have investigated 
an elk abduction.

502
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,517
I have investigated 
crop formations.

503
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,086
Takes a lot of, 
a lot of resources

504
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,687
to investigate a case.

505
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,556
DAVID: 
You brought up 
the elk case

506
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,591
that you investigated 
in Washington?

507
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,227
I was actually at a conference 
when the call came in.

508
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:55,567
He told the story about 
14 or 15 people I think it 
was,

509
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,203
who were out 
planting trees 
on a hillside,

510
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,605
on big piece of property owned

511
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,175
by a commercial 
logging company.

512
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,345
They had seen an object 
approach from the East,

513
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,282
and they stood there and 
watched it for a few seconds.

514
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,952
He called the, the object 
to the attention of the 
workers,

515
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,488
and they all looked up 
and saw it as well.

516
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,826
And it flew towards 
a herd of elk,

517
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,628
that these guys have been 
watching all morning long

518
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,730
as they worked on a hillside.

519
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,568
All the elk bolted 
to the northeast to heavy 
cover,

520
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,736
except for one hapless elk.

521
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,506
And the object

522
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,775
lifted the elk off the ground,

523
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,512
and it started moving slowly 
in the direction

524
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,848
in which 
that herd of elk had gone

525
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,685
and it came to a large tree, 
an evergreen tree

526
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,754
and bumped into it, 
interestingly.

527
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,691
And backed away from the tree.

528
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,126
And then suddenly 
shot to the north

529
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,797
and went over 
the nearest ridge 
to the north.

530
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,333
I called the individual back

531
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,834
who had made 
the call to the hotline

532
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,036
and who had left a message.

533
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,006
And arranged 
to travel to the site.

534
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,810
DAVID: Was the company 
that the property was on

535
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,979
assisting in this research?

536
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,316
They directed question 
to Peter Davenport.

537
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,718
Let's put it that way.

538
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,152
So were they interested?

539
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,654
Definitely.

540
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,190
What's general nationality 
of the workers?

541
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,391
Hispanic.

542
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,792
Would they speak English?

543
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:32,430
No. Nobody really knew 
exactly what went on,

544
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:36,234
until we got 
some good translation.

545
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,904
That's when I decided 
we needed to get somebody

546
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,940
that was one, 
in the UFO community

547
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,808
and two, 
who could translate well,

548
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,779
and that's when I contacted 
Ruben down in California,

549
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,549
I had contacted 
uh, some of the workers

550
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,619
and to arrange for us to meet

551
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,023
and gain their trust too

552
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,792
because these gentlemen 
were pretty shook up.

553
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,796
I would say they were 
in their late 20s, early 30s.

554
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,599
They were married, 
they have families.

555
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:11,703
Yeah. They 
were responsible folks.

556
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,406
The three witnesses 
saw this object

557
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:18,410
slowly descending 
and it went toward 
the elk herd,

558
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,478
which caused the elk to run,

559
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,481
but he was able 
to see the object

560
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,783
picking up the elk.

561
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,851
It was not a big 
object at all.

562
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,987
The witnesses emphasized

563
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,691
how surprised they were 
at how small it was

564
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,560
and still be able to lift 
an elk out of the forest.

565
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,496
What they did 
was they looked at the elk,

566
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,131
they looked at the craft 
and they said,

567
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,467
"Well, okay, 
if the elk is this big,

568
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,306
"the craft is gonna 
be somewhere between 
six and eight feet long.

569
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,544
"About five feet wide 
with a little indentation 
in the back.

570
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,212
"About 18 inches thick.

571
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,783
"It had a red 
and a white stripe 
that weren't lights,

572
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:03,088
"but the white stripe 
was like a bright enamel 
paint,

573
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,957
"the red stripe 
was a duller color."

574
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,826
So when the men in the group

575
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,263
-saw this craft take 
the elk out of sight... 
-Yeah.

576
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,999
...what was the distance 
from where they were

577
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,234
to where 
they finally saw it?

578
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:20,872
I would say the trees 
where it ran into 
is quarter mile.

579
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,708
But basically I think 
it became a small dot

580
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,745
before it disappeared 
into the cloud cover.

581
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,715
Down trip was silent,

582
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,518
and as soon as 
it got over the elk,

583
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,787
the elk was 
basically paralyzed.

584
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,555
It looked like 
it was a statue.

585
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,957
It was just stiff.

586
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,059
DAVID: The distance 
of the elk from the craft

587
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,361
-always stayed consistent? 
-Yes.

588
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:47,399
How thick was the cable 
between the craft and the elk?

589
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,733
There was no cable.

590
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,771
There was nothing discernible

591
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,206
that was holding 
the elk to the craft.

592
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,076
The movement was like, 
like a coin.

593
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,445
Uh, it was a slow oscillation.

594
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:06,584
It took about 
two-and-half seconds 
for it to complete a cycle,

595
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:11,890
and it's as if, 
if you've ever spun a coin

596
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,759
and when that coin 
is getting lower and lower,

597
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,696
so it's almost flat 
and it goes around on its rim,

598
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,498
that's the type 
of oscillation.

599
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,301
What are 
the chances, Peter, 
that, that could have been

600
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,470
some kind of test vehicle 
that our military has,

601
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,806
and they were just trying 
out their technology?

602
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,809
About as close to zero 
as you can get.

603
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,912
-Could the craft 
have been a helicopter? 
-No.

604
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,615
In your research 
as an investigator 
is that common?

605
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,883
Yes, there are many times

606
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,286
so in reports that we get

607
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,021
uh, from witnesses.

608
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:47,125
They'll say that 
they heard no noise at all.

609
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,862
-Did you ever go out 
and try to find the elk? 
-We did.

610
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,532
We found what we think 
may have been the elk.

611
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,236
Uh, it was a dead creature 
by the time we got to it,

612
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,673
but we did a 
cursory examination

613
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,808
could find no bullet holes,

614
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,543
no arrows sticking in it,

615
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,579
no wounds. 
It had good teeth.

616
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,980
It was well fed.

617
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:12,951
We think it was a female, 
pregnant female elk.

618
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,553
Describe the setting 
that you saw the elk in?

619
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,989
It was beside a road,

620
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,426
and it was in the valley, 
to the north of the valley,

621
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,862
where these men 
were planting trees.

622
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,797
It leads me to suspect,

623
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,465
but I have no evidence

624
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:33,638
that the craft flew over 
the ridge to the north

625
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,240
of where these 
men were working,

626
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,775
and may have dropped the elk

627
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,277
or lifted off.

628
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,279
DAVID: 
So how many days 
was it from the time

629
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,449
that they saw the elk 
get pulled up by the craft

630
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,418
until someone found 
that elk on the road?

631
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:52,790
The elk was found before 
seven days had transpired.

632
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,425
Does that case 
rank up there with you

633
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,395
as far as strangeness 
and credibility?

634
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,865
Yeah, it's 
a pretty strange case.

635
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,269
Uh, it's not every day 
that witnesses see a UFO

636
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,072
what we presume was a UFO, 
an alien spacecraft

637
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,910
lift an animal 
off the ground 
and fly off with it.

638
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,245
That's pretty unusual 
by any measure.

639
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,214
Were any of them 
concerned that,

640
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,483
"Hey, maybe one of these 
things could come over and 
take me"?

641
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,552
Yeah.

642
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,921
-Did they voice that concern? 
-Yes, they did.

643
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,990
They... Some weren't 
quite sure if they wanted

644
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,493
to go back to the woods 
and work again.

645
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:32,997
Listening to his voice, 
and I could really see

646
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,634
the actual event 
that's happening to him

647
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,736
as he's describing it.

648
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,071
And he was shook up about it.

649
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,106
Was he emotional?

650
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,876
From what I recall, 
he had a hard time sleeping

651
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,813
for several days 
after he saw that.

652
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,082
His words were whether... 
he thought,

653
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,451
"Whether it was 
something prehistoric

654
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,420
"or was something 
extraterrestrial."

655
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,755
So when you heard 
that this elk was taken

656
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,459
and you 
and you heard the witnesses,

657
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,995
at the end of the 
investigation what was your 
belief,

658
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,965
credible, incredible, 
borderline?

659
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,367
It was credible. 
Everyone was credible.

660
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,040
No one appeared 
to be wanting to...

661
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,179
mmm, force 
a story about anything.

662
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,081
It was just the opposite.

663
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,918
They were reluctant, 
really upset them.

664
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,954
They really didn't even 
wanna think about it.

665
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,658
Did they give you 
any indication at all 
that this was fabrication?

666
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,826
No, David.

667
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,961
I would stake my reputation.

668
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,930
No, they were 
telling the truth.

669
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,899
DAVID: 
After the interview, 
I received a call

670
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,636
from Robert Fairfax 
regarding the dead elk.

671
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,706
-Hey, Robert. 
-Hi, Dave.

672
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,410
I'm calling back because 
when we did the interview 
of...

673
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,179
there's a couple of things 
I forgot to add.

674
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:58,683
I did meet with 
a representative 
of the company.

675
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:03,254
When Peter and I initially 
went down to find the elk,

676
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,390
it had a chronic 
wasting disease,

677
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:10,128
prion disease, 
that affects the brain

678
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:16,701
and they had been finding 
quite a few elks, 
dead elks in the area.

679
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,939
So in the 1980s, in the UK,

680
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,343
there was something 
called, "mad cow disease".

681
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,513
It's a prion disease, 
and it infected cows.

682
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:33,384
In the UK, they initially said 
that these animals

683
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:37,722
couldn't transmit 
the disease to people.

684
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,223
And they said not to worry.

685
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,926
But it ended up 
transferring to people

686
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,861
and it killed hundreds.

687
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,765
And the UK 
ended up slaughtering 
over four-million cattle

688
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,336
because of this prion disease 
that we know as mad cow.

689
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,639
In the U.S. there's something 
that's come about,

690
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,308
where chronic wasting disease

691
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:02,313
is now infecting deer, 
moose, elk, cervids,

692
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,284
and this disease 
has spread across the U.S.

693
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,621
and it centered 
on Colorado and Wyoming.

694
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:15,727
This disease is fatal 
100% of the time to all 
cervids.

695
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,500
The state governments 
of each of the 50 states

696
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:27,705
have told hunters 
to get their animals tested

697
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,541
and not to eat the meat 
of an infected animal.

698
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,612
And they've never stated yet 
that this can transfer to 
human.

699
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,983
But it's consistent in that 
it says, "Don't eat the 
animal."

700
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:45,390
Chronic wasting disease, 
seems to be something 
that is out of control.

701
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:49,293
State and federal governments 
don't have an answer 
on how to control it.

702
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,262
And right now 
it seems as though

703
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,398
there's some 
type of monitoring

704
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:59,670
going on across the U.S. 
of these infected animals.

705
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,807
DAVID: In Washington, 
Peter Davenport

706
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,412
identified one case 
and attributed it to CWD.

707
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,848
Now he identified a case 
in the state of Idaho,

708
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,485
involving hunters, 
that is equally as unusual.

709
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,588
Hi, I'm Chris Bales,

710
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:22,260
and I have a little incident 
that I ran into

711
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,430
on September 27th, 
the year 2000.

712
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,033
Um, something that most people

713
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:32,370
would never ever see 
or believe.

714
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:37,041
We were in the 
middle of Idaho,

715
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,944
out in a pretty remote area.

716
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,245
DAVID: 
Who were you with?

717
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,282
Um, I was with 
my brother Mark,

718
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,517
and a friend of ours,

719
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:52,423
through construction, Rob 
and then his dad was with us.

720
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,959
DAVID: Describe the spot 
where you were camping?

721
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,561
Hard to get down in, 
and then when you

722
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,496
get down in, 
it was pretty tight.

723
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:03,334
Um, steep canyon 
and tall timber.

724
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,504
And it was kind of a dark, 
dark hole down in there.

725
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,206
DAVID: And had you been 
to the spot before?

726
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,541
We had. We've been 
there for several years.

727
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,144
-So you knew it well? 
-We knew it well, yeah.

728
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,046
CHRIS: 
We had some mules

729
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,319
to hopefully, usually pack 
an animal out that we 
harvested.

730
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,754
Described the day

731
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,457
and how it started 
on this specific incident?

732
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,227
We would start early, I mean, 
like four in the morning.

733
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,596
Drive to a spot 
and then hike for

734
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,931
maybe an hour 
or two in the dark.

735
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,467
CHRIS BALE: 
Work 
our way around, spotted elk,

736
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,438
trying to follow the elk 
and look at some high lakes

737
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,807
that we'd never seen before 
and never got up in there.

738
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,944
We'd try and get back 
to the vehicles 
just before dark.

739
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,247
On this day, 
you guys come back,

740
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,849
you fix some dinner, 
explain what happened then?

741
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,618
I had finished my supper

742
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,821
and went out to take a whiz

743
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:01,092
and was starting back 
to the trailer,

744
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:03,294
and Chris came out.

745
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:07,798
I was, I don't know, 
maybe 15-feet from the 
trailer.

746
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,969
And when I stepped down, 
obviously your head goes up.

747
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:17,275
The light went across, 
hit on something 
that's right there,

748
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,545
and instant, instantly

749
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,814
that it was something 
that I didn't comprehend,

750
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,016
whatsoever.

751
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,318
When I saw that,

752
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,054
that's when I, you know, 
went down on my knees.

753
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:34,325
I just kind of 
turned to my right, 
went down on my knees.

754
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,063
Chris looks up 
and just goes Holy--

755
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,365
Shit. Holy shit! Holy shit!

756
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,267
You guys have got to see this.

757
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,571
I look up and I see 
what he's looking at.

758
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,241
CHRIS: 
And I mean, 
I was quivering. I yelled.

759
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,077
I was yelling basically 
at the top of my voice.

760
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,915
Mark came out of the trailer, 
and he said that, you know,

761
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:02,153
he heard my voice and he'd 
never heard me sound that way 
before.

762
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:06,757
He runs out 
and I just point up, up above.

763
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:11,629
It was huge. 
It was like a football field.

764
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:16,233
Hundred feet, direction, 
direction, triangular shape.

765
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:22,673
So how far was the bottom 
of that craft from you 
in your estimate?

766
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:29,146
I would say 
80-feet plus or minus 
somewhere near above us.

767
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,948
Rivets? Canals?

768
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,417
No, that was, 
that was one of the things 
that,

769
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,087
I am in construction, 
I like detail.

770
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,590
Um, I was looking at that 
and that the detail just...

771
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:45,429
I couldn't believe, you know, 
there's, there's no seams, 
no rivets, no joints.

772
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:49,667
It's all just 
one perfect surface in that.

773
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,437
You could just tell 
it was perfect in every way.

774
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:57,908
The thing that got me the most 
was how close it was...

775
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,045
and no noise.

776
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,213
Nothing.

777
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:06,517
No prop voice. 
No... breeze.

778
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,956
No exhaust, 
nothing you could smell.

779
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,259
Zero.

780
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,595
And it was a calm night. 
No wind.

781
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,530
By that time, 
it's starting to move up

782
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:23,567
and Mark and Rob both 
grabbed their binoculars

783
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,504
and we just 
watched it just float...

784
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:31,475
up the draw, just slowly, 
no noise.

785
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,412
Um, animals didn't make noise.

786
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,748
Those mules 
never made a sound,

787
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,785
and they never 
made any motion.

788
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,454
I mean, they, like, 
nothing was going on.

789
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,058
We weren't making any noise, 
just kind of in awe

790
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,960
of what's going on 
and not knowing what it is.

791
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,129
I'm thinking, 
"Man, that's sure no 
airplane."

792
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,367
We actually 
took pieces of paper

793
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,037
and drew up 
our own pictures

794
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,007
and wrote down information.

795
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,912
So, Chris, I came across this. 
Did you draw that?

796
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:09,080
I did draw this.

797
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,481
Is that what it looked like?

798
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,651
That's as similar 
as what I could come up with.

799
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,953
What were the black dots 
outside the craft?

800
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,322
Don't know. 
I just remember seeing them.

801
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:22,159
Um, didn't seem 
like there was anything, um...

802
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:29,366
And was the red dot painted 
or did it glow like the white?

803
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,836
It glowed like the white disc.

804
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,605
Did the white lights 
also protrude from the bottom?

805
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,842
Uh, it looked like maybe 
they were semi-domed.

806
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:43,447
But it was not really 
pronounced like the drawing.

807
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:49,386
You know, you draw that, 
it was more of white fog,

808
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,556
um, circle, 
not really unique,

809
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,793
sharp edges or fine detail.

810
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,096
DAVID: 
Could it 
have been watching Rob?

811
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,298
Could he have been 
a target for abduction

812
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,234
and Chris coming 
out of the trailer,

813
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,202
thwarted that abduction?

814
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,472
Triangular craft like this 
have been seen 
around the world,

815
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:12,676
including, most recently 
by our own 
U.S. Military pilots.

816
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,979
That night, 
did you stay in camp?

817
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:16,947
Tried to,

818
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,984
but just couldn't 
bring myself to do it.

819
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,920
Did you get to know anybody 
else who lived in that general 
area

820
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,822
and asked them if they'd seen 
something like this?

821
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,225
There was people that we knew 
that were in the area.

822
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,095
So Mark kind of hedged on,

823
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:36,500
"Have you guys ever seen 
anything kind of different,

824
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,371
"you know, at some point 
or anything like that 
out in the valley?"

825
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:44,241
And so little conversation 
about it.

826
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,710
I just, we were standing, 
you know, on the dirt road

827
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:51,415
and I put the toe of my boot 
down and said, "Well, did you 
see something like this?"

828
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:52,950
And started to draw

829
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,287
a triangle 
with my boot in the dirt

830
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,090
and I drew a straight line 
and the guy standing next to 
me

831
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,660
took his foot 
and pushed my foot away

832
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,197
and he finished 
my drawing for me on that.

833
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,733
And that was, 
there was nothing said 
or anything

834
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,269
but that he finished 
my drawing.

835
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,705
DAVID: 
Is that 
some sort of 
validation for you?

836
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,841
Um, well, 
it made me feel like,

837
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:21,478
"Yeah, okay. 
Other people have noticed 
this."

838
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:26,550
And so yeah, 
I guess it's a validation.

839
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,886
So it did affect you?

840
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,921
Oh, it did.

841
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,826
I guess, I'm 
vacillating maybe.

842
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,898
Since that night in 2000, 
anywhere that you've been out,

843
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:45,069
-have you seen other 
unidentified things in the 
sky? -No.

844
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,237
How about Mark and Rob?

845
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,805
No, the same thing, you know,

846
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,675
never really seen anything 
that even...

847
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,712
would have guessed at it.

848
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,815
So, Rob, there's gonna be 
people that watch this,

849
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,984
and they're gonna say, 
"I don't believe it,"

850
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,052
you know, "It didn't happen," 
and all that,

851
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,388
-these guys-- 
-And I would be one of them.

852
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:06,991
-You'd be one of them? 
-[LAUGHS] Yeah.

853
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,193
So if you saw this story, 
you wouldn't believe these 
guys?

854
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,863
Well, I'm skeptical.

855
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,566
But I saw it.

856
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,502
And how many times 
have you gone back 
to that same site since?

857
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,371
-The exact site? 
-Yeah.

858
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,705
Never.

859
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:29,046
When we talk about 
the triangle UFO sighting 
by the hunters,

860
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:37,521
I didn't realize at the time 
but its location on a map

861
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:42,192
coincides with 
the first documentary I did

862
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:47,197
called 
Missing 411 
that involved 
the disappearance of DeOrr 
Kunz.

863
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,802
When I look at the map... 
directly east,

864
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,673
of the sighting of the 
triangle by the hunters,

865
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,244
is the exact location 
that DeOrr disappeared.

866
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,949
Now when you think about 
the vastness of the 
wilderness,

867
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,851
what are the chances 
that these two incidents

868
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,788
happened in such a close 
proximity to one another?

869
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,793
But also looking at the map 
and my case files,

870
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,028
it also coincides

871
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,332
with the disappearance 
of Ray Jones.

872
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:27,805
Now Ray was a 39-year-old 
service station owner in 
Salmon,

873
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,741
who disappeared 53 years ago

874
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:35,079
on a hunting expedition 
with friends.

875
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,115
They separated, 
Ray disappeared,

876
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,820
and for 53 years 
he wasn't found.

877
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,391
Now a group of hunters

878
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:53,197
that saw this, 
the triangular UFO, 
their dad actually knew Ray.

879
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,967
And so every time 
they went out, 
and hunted this area,

880
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,037
they said that they were 
looking for Ray as well.

881
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,174
He wasn't found 
and then he's found this year

882
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,343
at the bottom 
of a boulder field

883
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,846
in an area that had been 
previously searched

884
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,347
dozens of times.

885
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,883
Suddenly he's found there.

886
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,287
And when you map 
these three incidents,

887
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,393
you have a very neat triangle.

888
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:31,502
Which, weirdly, coincides 
with the shape of the triangle

889
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,771
that was drawn by the hunters.

890
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,452
Are there any new major 
developments in the case?

891
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,091
Not really.

892
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,427
-Has DeOrr been found? 
-No.

893
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,363
Are there any named suspects?

894
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,067
Not at this time.

895
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,071
When an investigation 
starts to push the limits

896
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,673
of standard everyday 
police protocol,

897
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,241
I start to look 
for professionals

898
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,143
on the outside 
that could assist me.

899
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,913
I'm someone who's not

900
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,415
so stubborn as to admit 
what I don't know.

901
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,551
And at this point,

902
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,219
I looked for professional help

903
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,490
in the name of 
retired FBI agent John 
DeSouza.

904
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,958
My name is John DeSouza.

905
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:31,295
I was an FBI special agent 
for 25 years.

906
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:35,132
I've worked all types of cases 
counterterrorism,

907
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,068
uh, violent crimes, 
paranormal cases as well.

908
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,771
And I am pretty well known 
for that sort of thing.

909
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,306
Now, your background 
to me is interesting

910
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:46,510
because you've worked 
a variety of criminal cases.

911
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,479
I worked on the 
Unabomber case.

912
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:53,383
I worked on 1994 
World Trade Center bombing.

913
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,252
DAVID: 
The biggest case 
you ever worked?

914
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,954
JOHN: 
It would 
have to be 9/11.

915
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,722
John, how many times 
have you testified

916
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,992
in front of the in front 
of a U.S. Court 
for a U.S. attorney?

917
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,228
Maybe like 100 times.

918
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,896
And how many times 
has the court decided

919
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,631
that you're an expert 
in a certain area?

920
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,333
Probably every time 
I've testified.

921
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,001
I can't think of anybody

922
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,705
who's in a position 
more to tell the truth,

923
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:18,075
and with great things 
to risk than you.

924
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,676
No. No.

925
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,079
I've had agents 
in the past say,

926
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,349
"Well, Dave, 
if there is a series of events

927
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,485
"that all kind of line up...

928
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,589
"similar to what you have 
written about," meaning me,

929
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:37,728
"then those agents could be 
forwarding those reports 
to a profiling unit,

930
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:41,198
"and they're putting 
the pieces together 
to see if there's 
connections."

931
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,066
Exactly. Yeah, it's true, too.

932
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,969
So who would be 
directing those agents?

933
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:52,776
That could be Washington, 
it could be profiler unit 
of Behavioral Sciences Unit.

934
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:58,348
Are there subject matter 
experts on UFOs, aliens, 
abductions?

935
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,686
Well, that's what I was 
while I was during the, 
in the FBI.

936
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,022
And what was 
your conclusion in general

937
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,624
about these people 
that claim abductions

938
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,326
and disappear and come back?

939
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,329
We report on the ones 
that we talk about,

940
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,431
um, those are real.

941
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:19,336
And I do believe 
that they are connected

942
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:25,209
to extra dimensional beings, 
beings that come from 
outside of our reality.

943
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,377
In many, many of my stories...

944
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:31,181
uh, families in the woods...

945
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,916
children are right 
next to them...

946
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,385
Everything's fine.

947
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:39,056
They turn around one second 
and the kid's gone.

948
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,724
They're not 
anywhere to be found,

949
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,226
and the statement 
from the parents

950
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,328
is, "They were right there,

951
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,430
"and then the next second, 
they're gone."

952
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,131
Now, if that is true,

953
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,500
that really does answer 
a conundrum about

954
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,870
-how they can disappear 
and nobody can realize it? 
-Right.

955
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:58,375
Time period is so short 
that their disappearance

956
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:02,813
is not possible 
in a purely physical world.

957
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:06,316
So when you investigated 
something like this,

958
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,151
were you ever 
questioned later on

959
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,921
by other departments 
or other agencies?

960
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,892
No, not by other agencies, no.

961
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,961
Departments?

962
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,498
No. They don't 
want to know this sort of 
thing

963
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:26,536
as much as... 
as much as they can avoid 
the knowledge of this. No.

964
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,804
Long time ago,

965
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,873
this is back 
when I was a policeman,

966
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,541
and there were some FBI guys

967
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,144
that were working a case 
on something else.

968
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,746
We were talking about,

969
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,348
I don't even think it was 
anything spooky or paranormal,

970
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:42,052
but it was something unrelated 
and the agent said,

971
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:46,857
"Dave, our government 
will never acknowledge 
what they can't control."

972
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,059
And I always 
remembered that statement.

973
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,095
-Do you believe that? 
-Yeah, that's absolutely true.

974
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,365
They can't acknowledge it 
if they can't control it,

975
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:59,136
or even if they think 
they can't control it.

976
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,674
Wow. What can I say?

977
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:09,980
John DeSouza fits your 
typical model of an FBI agent,

978
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,381
and I've dealt with several

979
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,483
during my years 
in law enforcement.

980
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:17,254
Ultra-credible, 
tons of experience,

981
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,457
a stand-up guy 
who is speaking the truth.

982
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,728
And during my time 
sitting in his office,

983
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:30,233
you probably couldn't tell, 
but I was in stunned silence

984
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:35,272
just listening to how 
he laid out the groundwork

985
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,241
for so many issues 
related to our work.

986
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:42,379
And he brought 
instant credibility

987
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,014
to an arena

988
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,450
where a lot of people 
don't even wanna address.

989
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,519
John's statement

990
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:56,993
about parallel dimensions, 
his overview of missing people

991
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,062
and his statement 
about our work,

992
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,101
all fell right in line 
with the 1,500 people

993
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,670
I've documented 
in the last 12 years.

994
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,173
But that brings up 
a one of the cases

995
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,543
that has continually sat 
in the back of my mind.

996
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,312
That's the incident 
of the disappearance

997
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,447
of Reinhard 
Kirchner in Arizona.

998
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,517
So this is the spot.

999
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,486
In April 2007,

1000
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,522
Reinhard Kirchner 
made his way from Germany.

1001
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,225
He was a physicist.

1002
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,694
He drove his rented 
camper truck here,

1003
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,431
parked it and started to hike.

1004
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,634
He'd been here before, 
and he liked it.

1005
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,605
Reinhard didn't 
make his meeting 
with his girlfriend

1006
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:46,009
at Las Vegas McCarran Airport, 
she called search and rescue.

1007
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:51,314
Eventually found his truck 
parked here on Navajo 
property.

1008
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:55,619
Started to search several 
days. They found nothing.

1009
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:59,823
They know 
that he took his camera 
and took a small backpack

1010
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,358
and he walked into oblivion.

1011
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,594
Interesting part 
of the case was

1012
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:07,464
while the Sheriff 
was at his truck,

1013
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,000
there were some local ranchers

1014
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,401
that walked up 
and talked to him,

1015
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,270
and these people said that

1016
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,905
during the time 
Reinhard was gone,

1017
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:19,843
they had seen 
unusual lights in the sky 
here.

1018
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:23,647
And what is important 
about that to me 
as a law enforcement person,

1019
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,617
is that they put that 
in the report as credible.

1020
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,153
His girlfriend eventually 
flew home to Germany.

1021
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:34,391
It's been over a decade, 
Reinhard and his property 
has never been found.

1022
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,927
What compelled 
Reinhard to this location?

1023
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,228
The case remains open,

1024
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,964
and we may 
never find the answers.

1025
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:44,067
There is one particular case 
where credibility 
and evidence merge

1026
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,238
in one of the most bizarre 
cases I've ever investigated.

1027
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,073
One where the hunter 
reappeared with a story

1028
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,409
that tested 
the limits of believability

1029
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,544
yet captured my imagination

1030
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,280
and strangely 
physical evidence.

1031
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,450
My name is Carl Higdon.

1032
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,255
And this is 
to talk about an incident

1033
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,725
that happened in 1974.

1034
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,395
I told my wife that,

1035
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,931
I'm gonna go south 
and go hunting.

1036
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,101
DAVID: What percentage 
of the time 
that he went out hunting

1037
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,703
did you go with him?

1038
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,204
MARJORIE: Always.

1039
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,673
-Except this time? 
-Yes.

1040
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:27,744
Carl and I are together, 
mostly 24/7.

1041
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:30,547
So on October 25th, '74...

1042
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,283
He went, he went out 
by himself completely.

1043
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,185
DAVID: 
And was that a rare occasion?

1044
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,586
MARJORIE: 
Yes, very rare.

1045
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,624
So that area 
where this happened,

1046
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,626
had you ever been 
there before?

1047
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,561
No.

1048
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,696
Describe the best you can 
where this happened at,

1049
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:51,234
-which forest were you in? 
-Medicine Bow National Forest.

1050
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:55,438
The area that 
this happened in,

1051
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,842
was back to 
the north, right at the edge 
of the forest.

1052
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:04,614
So I got inside 
the national forest.

1053
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:08,752
I walked down 
maybe three-quarter 
of a mile.

1054
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,588
I had seen five elk.

1055
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,224
They didn't move.

1056
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,793
There was another 
strange thing.

1057
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,428
They what? Say that again?

1058
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,663
They didn't move.

1059
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,865
They just sat there.

1060
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:28,438
Carl entered the woods, 
lined up on a series of elk.

1061
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,207
He even said 
that the elk weren't moving,

1062
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,010
leveled his rifle 
at the animals,

1063
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,111
pulled the trigger.

1064
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,913
He says his gun went off.

1065
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,251
The bullet came out 
the end of the barrel

1066
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,688
and hit some type 
of invisible force field

1067
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,790
and dropped to the ground.

1068
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,960
That bullet 
was recovered by Carl

1069
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:53,530
and later analyzed, 
and it did hit something,

1070
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,600
what, we don't know.

1071
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:01,571
But the unusual nature 
of the travel 
of that ammunition

1072
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:05,275
is so odd 
that I've never heard of it

1073
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,777
in any type of 
research before.

1074
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,513
You're standing there. 
You shot the rifle.

1075
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:14,084
You're turning 
and you see the craft.

1076
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:17,420
Give me as much detail 
as you can on that craft, 
Carl.

1077
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:22,559
Well, it was like looking 
at a piece of glass.

1078
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,063
Only it had motors around it.

1079
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,701
I couldn't figure out 
what it was to start with.

1080
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,504
So when you're looking 
at the at the cube,

1081
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,407
can you see through it 
and see forest behind it?

1082
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,042
Yes.

1083
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,378
Was there anything 
in the cube?

1084
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,113
Not that I could see.

1085
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:48,018
So it was just like 
a glass square on four sides,

1086
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:51,788
seven foot-by-five foot 
with nothing inside it,

1087
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,490
and you can 
kind of see through it.

1088
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:54,858
CARL: 
Right.

1089
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,193
What did you think 
when you first saw it?

1090
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,796
[LAUGHS] I didn't know.

1091
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:05,902
I just kinda stared at it 
because it was unusual.

1092
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:12,375
Then this guy showed up 
and asked me if I was hungry.

1093
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,078
Told him, "Yeah."

1094
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:20,517
So this packet of four pills 
drifted over to me,

1095
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,420
just like it was thrown at me.

1096
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,124
I took one.

1097
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:34,664
Next thing I know 
I was in this cubicle, 
but it looked a lot nearer.

1098
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,701
There's five elk behind me.

1099
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,703
I said, "You got my elk."

1100
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,406
He just looked at me 
and shrugged.

1101
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,643
Told me 
that his name was Ausso...

1102
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:51,815
and they were down here 
to get food.

1103
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,652
I said, "You guys 
always come down?"

1104
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,489
He said, "Yeah. 
We come down every so often.

1105
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,960
"We get elk, deer from here.

1106
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:08,998
"And go the ocean 
and get fish and take it 
back."

1107
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,502
MARJORIE: This is the drawing 
that Carl drew in the 
hospital.

1108
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,905
And the, the being 
had a, like a hand,

1109
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,409
that was a cone 
and no hand here,

1110
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,144
and his hair was like straw.

1111
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,648
-And-- 
-DAVID: So this is 
a very descriptive drawing.

1112
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,951
What are these little things?

1113
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,153
MARJORIE: Um, 
this is kind of an apron,

1114
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:34,824
and it shows where the uh, 
kind of where the land is,

1115
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,059
in his planet.

1116
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,628
Did he-- Did Ausso 
seem to have a personality?

1117
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:41,865
He seemed to.

1118
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,067
Like...

1119
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,672
When he talked to me, 
his lips never moved.

1120
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,709
I mean, it was back and forth.

1121
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,079
But...

1122
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,383
He seemed like he knew a lot.

1123
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:03,987
-What color was his suit? 
-Black.

1124
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,221
DAVID: Black.

1125
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,724
The entire suit was black?

1126
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:12,262
MARJORIE: Completely black 
because our sun burns them.

1127
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,564
So they have to wear black

1128
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:19,002
and they wear like, uh, 
like a scuba diver's suit.

1129
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:20,904
Covers them completely.

1130
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,139
Did Carl ever say 
if he only had one hand

1131
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,775
-and didn't draw the second? 
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

1132
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,944
He did not 
have another hand here.

1133
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,079
But he had 
like a cone over here.

1134
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,483
Carl ever have an opinion 
if this was a male or a 
female?

1135
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:37,220
-Uh, oh, he figures 
it was a male. 
-A male.

1136
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:41,891
And then this is uh picture 
of the, um, the craft.

1137
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,694
And this was the controls.

1138
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:50,033
This is where Ausso sat 
and this is where Carl sat.

1139
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:54,671
And there was still 
five elk in here also.

1140
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,806
And when we lifted off...

1141
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:02,145
and then I could see 
it looked like a ball... 
down below.

1142
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,215
I figured it was the Earth.

1143
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,516
I didn't know.

1144
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:07,851
And he was taken 
to some place that could

1145
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,686
best be described 
as another planet.

1146
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,087
It took him behind a screen

1147
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,557
and eventually said, 
"We don't need you.

1148
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,192
"You don't fit what we need."

1149
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,862
The implication to Carl being 
is that he had a vasectomy

1150
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,565
and they needed somebody 
that was 100-percent fertile.

1151
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:26,369
CARL: 
I said, "What? 
I got to go home?"

1152
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,906
And he said, "Don't worry. 
Somebody'll come get you,"

1153
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:36,045
and dropped me off 
and I hit side of this hill 
and rolled down it.

1154
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,982
This is a critical point.

1155
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,918
When Carl explained 
that he was dropped,

1156
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,288
I have investigated 
hundreds of cases

1157
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,290
with unusual circumstances

1158
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:51,194
that show that someone 
was dropped into that 
location.

1159
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:54,731
This isn't something 
that's normally talked about 
in investigations.

1160
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,599
A lot of times 
it's just pushed off

1161
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,801
as happenstance 
and an accident

1162
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:01,304
that the person 
fell into the place.

1163
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,908
There's much more to this 
and Carl has explained it.

1164
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:09,012
It was after I got off work, 
I felt the need to go to him.

1165
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:13,516
I felt that he needed me, 
that I had to go help him.

1166
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:17,453
DAVID: 
So you get out there, 
you have the sheriff there

1167
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,056
and everyone's looking.

1168
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:23,259
You're sitting on the hill, 
and you eventually get told

1169
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,028
-that they found Carl? 
-Mm-hmm.

1170
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,830
The Deputy Sheriff 
got out of the pickup,

1171
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:30,767
crouched down with his gun,

1172
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,169
ready to shoot Carl 
if he had to

1173
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:37,106
because we did not know, 
what, what was going on?

1174
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,610
So, so from visually 
looking at Carl then,

1175
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,013
did he even seem like 
it was your husband?

1176
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,850
Uh, he kept looking out 
through the windshield

1177
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:51,587
and saying, "My elk, my elk, 
They took my elk.

1178
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,623
"They took my elk."

1179
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,224
Who did you think, 
"they" were?

1180
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,627
I had no idea 
what he was even talking 
about.

1181
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,964
-DAVID: 
So at the hospital, 
they do a full examination? 
-Mm-hmm.

1182
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:04,400
They checked him over 
with a fine-tooth comb.

1183
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:08,037
First, they wanted to know 
if he was on any drugs.

1184
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,639
He was not.

1185
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:13,076
And when I ask him, 
the Dr. Tongco,

1186
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,245
about, about the spots 
on his lungs,

1187
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,748
he said, "What spots? 
There are no spots."

1188
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,985
And in the X-ray, 
they found that 
his lungs were completely 
clear,

1189
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,188
which was highly 
suspicious and unusual

1190
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,424
because Carl had 
tuberculosis scars 
on his lungs.

1191
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:32,795
So something happened 
while he was gone 
that cleared that up.

1192
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,097
At the time, 
did you think that

1193
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,499
maybe something 
happened on that ship

1194
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,368
that they made 
you pure and clean?

1195
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,807
No, I think it was, 
when I was behind the screen 
up there

1196
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:49,312
because that's what he said,

1197
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:52,281
"You're not what we want. 
We'll take you back."

1198
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:58,021
And I figured it was 
because of my vasectomy.

1199
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,722
But I'm not sure of that.

1200
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,426
DAVID: If it was 
because of the vasectomy,

1201
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:06,462
was the insinuation 
that if you didn't have one,

1202
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,997
you weren't coming back?

1203
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,767
[LAUGHING]

1204
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,336
That's what I gathered.

1205
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,907
So Carl insinuates 
that the entities 
didn't want him

1206
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,811
because his reproductive 
system wasn't intact.

1207
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,982
Now, if it was,

1208
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:29,285
we probably wouldn't even 
be talking about this story.

1209
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,523
DAVID: 
So I read a name

1210
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:36,192
and you can explain 
this to me, Dr. Leo Sprinkle.

1211
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,728
How did he 
come into the picture 
and what did he do?

1212
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,430
MARJORIE: 
He 
was a psychologist,

1213
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:44,133
and he was with 
the University of Wyoming.

1214
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:50,139
And he studies UFO-people, 
contactees.

1215
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:53,142
He could not say that 
he actually believed him.

1216
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,111
But he couldn't say 
that he did not.

1217
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,346
Carl took a lie detector test.

1218
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,850
In fact, he took, I don't 
know, three or four of them.

1219
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,485
What were the 
results of those?

1220
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,954
MARJORIE: 
He's telling 
the truth as he believes.

1221
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,192
CHRIS: 
I don't know 
what other people think.

1222
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:14,797
But if they don't believe it, 
they don't have to.

1223
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,202
I mean, everybody 
got their own opinion.

1224
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,238
I know what happened to me.

1225
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,478
I'm Richard Beckwith.

1226
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,547
I am the city attorney 
for the city of Rock Springs.

1227
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:35,284
I'm also the state director 
for the Mutual UFO Network

1228
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,286
and I have been 
a practicing attorney

1229
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,222
for the last 26 years.

1230
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,891
Can you give us 
a general overview 
of what MUFON does?

1231
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,594
We are a worldwide 
or global organization

1232
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:48,397
dedicated to the study of UFOs 
for the benefit of humanity.

1233
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,300
And I'd like to think that 
that is exactly what we do.

1234
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:55,471
An incident that I 
interviewed, the victim about

1235
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,707
was a man named Carl Higdon.

1236
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,308
I do remember 
that taking place.

1237
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,377
I think I was 14 years old 
when it happened.

1238
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,945
I'd like to know 
your thoughts about it.

1239
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,180
Well, first of all, I don't,

1240
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,082
I don't think 
that Carl was lying.

1241
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,951
I know Dr Sprinkle very well, 
Dr. Leo Sprinkle.

1242
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:12,989
He investigated that case 
and did some hypnosis,

1243
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,024
some regressive hypnosis 
with Mr. Higdon,

1244
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:19,495
and his impression of the case 
was that Mr. Higdon 
was telling the truth,

1245
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,831
or at least what 
he believed to be the truth.

1246
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:25,801
So some of the things 
about that case 
to me reeked of credibility.

1247
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:31,240
He had lung congestion 
and scarring on his lungs 
before the incident.

1248
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,177
And subsequent to it...

1249
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,179
-His lungs were clear. 
-RICHARD: Yeah.

1250
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:40,049
DAVID: And then 
the issue about the bullet

1251
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,451
coming out of the gun 
and stopping 
after hitting something

1252
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,321
-and being recovered 
and even analyzed... 
-Right. Yeah.

1253
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,423
They did examine the bullet

1254
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:50,126
and find that 
it had struck something

1255
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,828
and something really hard.

1256
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,665
It has these 
physiological characteristics

1257
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,533
that are just unexplained.

1258
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:00,169
DAVID: So in your experience 
and in your readings

1259
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:02,038
of people 
who have been abducted,

1260
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,840
how does 
the Higdon case compare

1261
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,810
as far as the 
physical evidence?

1262
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:14,584
Most abduction cases 
don't really involve 
a lot of physical evidence.

1263
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,686
We have the Higdon incident,

1264
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,854
a hunter,

1265
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:22,992
German surname, 
hunting elk by himself,

1266
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,527
claims he has been abducted.

1267
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,398
In that same general area, 
just last year,

1268
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,568
there was a guy 
named Mark Strittmater, 
you know about that case?

1269
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,070
RICHARD: 
A couple 
of different things

1270
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,905
that I find interesting 
about that case is that

1271
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,741
you've got an individual 
that's the same age,

1272
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,409
approximately as Mr. Higdon,

1273
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,312
also about 
the same time of year.

1274
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:47,850
Mr. Higdon's incident took 
place on October 25th 1974,

1275
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:52,755
and Mr. Strittmater went 
missing on October 19th,

1276
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:58,794
of 2019, 
almost 35 years 
exactly to the day

1277
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,230
in a relatively 
similar location.

1278
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,568
DAVID: So we're on 
Forest Road 801...

1279
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:10,006
And we are in the area

1280
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:13,309
where Mark Strittmater 
was coming

1281
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:16,245
to go elk hunting 
on October 19th, 2019

1282
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:18,281
in the 
Medicine Bow National Forest.

1283
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:23,119
In about 200 yards 
before Forest Road 830,

1284
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:26,355
he pulls to the side of the 
road for some reason,

1285
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,257
and there's 
some theories behind,

1286
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:31,060
maybe he was pulling over 
because he saw

1287
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,495
one of his hunting targets,

1288
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:36,098
big bull across the road, 
deer, who knows?

1289
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,267
But he pulls to the side 
of the road

1290
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:41,637
stops, gets out 
of his vehicle,

1291
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,006
and he takes a light coat,

1292
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,277
a light day pack 
leaves his big pack in the 
car,

1293
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,113
leaves his keys 
in the vehicle,

1294
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:53,049
and he gets out.

1295
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,453
Off camera, the search 
and rescue person told me

1296
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:03,192
that Mark 
was a 15-year veteran 
outfitter,

1297
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,294
for Big-Game in this area.

1298
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,464
So he knew 
the outdoors super well.

1299
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:09,732
He knew how to track

1300
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,735
and he knew elk 
didn't walk in a straight 
line.

1301
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:14,637
Elk take off and they wander.

1302
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:18,341
So to think that 
Mark is more than a mile,

1303
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:21,344
two miles from here, 
chasing an elk, 
doesn't make a lot of sense.

1304
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:23,245
My name is Kim Meese.

1305
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,814
I was girlfriend 
of Mark Strittmater

1306
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,115
when he went missing.

1307
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,383
In your view what--

1308
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,285
Wait, what made Mark special?

1309
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,154
He was just a giving person.

1310
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,825
So how comfortable 
was he in the woods?

1311
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:37,793
Oh, he grew up in the woods.

1312
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:42,298
He started hunting as soon 
as he could, 12, 13 years old.

1313
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,367
-He knew what he was doing. 
-Oh, yeah.

1314
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,169
In the area 
that he went missing from,

1315
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:49,271
where I found his truck at,

1316
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,574
we never hunted that area.

1317
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,209
But that morning 
that he had went out

1318
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:56,045
on the 19th 
that he went missing,

1319
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,347
I had already made plans 
to come to Rawlins

1320
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,283
to watch my grandkids.

1321
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,652
And he knew that 
there was a snowstorm coming 
in

1322
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:05,588
and I was worried about him.

1323
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:09,325
And, uh, he tried calling 
and sent me a text

1324
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:14,697
and said that 
he had missed an elk 
and that he was done.

1325
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,666
So I assumed 
he was coming back to 
Saratoga,

1326
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,271
which is a 40-minute drive 
from where we hunt from.

1327
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,407
So I hung out 
around the house 
for a little bit

1328
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,510
and he never showed up 
and I left,

1329
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:30,446
and I was trying 
to get hold of him that night

1330
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,615
to make sure 
he made it back 
before the snow hit

1331
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:37,353
and trying to call and text 
and texts weren't delivered.

1332
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,256
Phone calls are going 
directly to voicemail.

1333
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,759
I hauled ass up there, 
looking for the truck.

1334
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:46,762
And then when I got 
to that intersection, 
I looked to my left,

1335
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,231
and that's where I saw 
the pickup was sitting.

1336
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,667
Explain how it was sitting?

1337
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:56,505
It was on the east side 
of the road facing north.

1338
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,277
-Did it look like 
he parked it there? 
-Yeah.

1339
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,712
-Did it look out of place 
to you at all? 
-Yeah. Yeah.

1340
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,114
-It did? 
-It did.

1341
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:08,918
And when I got to it, 
like I said it had snowed

1342
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:14,557
and I had to clean off 
probably 12, 15 inches of snow 
just to get into it.

1343
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:19,995
And when we would hunt, 
we always left our key 
in our gas tank,

1344
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,665
so I was able 
to get in the truck,

1345
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:27,036
and that's when I found 
his phone and cigarettes, 
his medication.

1346
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,506
The only thing that was 
missing was him and his pack 
and gun.

1347
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,709
So when he texted you last, 
what did it say?

1348
01:08:33,742 --> 01:08:37,313
The last text it says, 
I got it at 11 o'clock

1349
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,781
says... [READING]

1350
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:56,532
So from that, it kind of 
sounded like he was done?

1351
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:58,467
Yeah, and that's 
what I assumed

1352
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,703
that maybe 
he was coming back to town.

1353
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,906
You find the truck, 
you can't find him?

1354
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:07,343
Do you look around at all? 
Or do you just call Sheriff?

1355
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,778
No, I walked around the area,

1356
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,915
just to see if I could see 
any tracks or anything.

1357
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,417
And I didn't see anything.

1358
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:18,654
So I came back to Saratoga

1359
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:20,890
and called 
the sheriff's deputy.

1360
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,692
So right off the 
bat we came in.

1361
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,027
The first day we came in

1362
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,262
with a whole bunch 
of ground pounders

1363
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,397
and we just went 
shoulder-to-shoulder

1364
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,932
and walked timber.

1365
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,800
And then we went around 
and picked a different spot

1366
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,503
near the truck 
and chose a different 
direction

1367
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:36,405
and started 
pounding more timber.

1368
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:39,942
DAVID: 
That initial search, 
how many days did it last?

1369
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:44,713
The first time around, 
I think, was seven days, 
if I'm not mistaken.

1370
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:48,017
It's like I said, 
we were gone 
for the first two days of it,

1371
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:52,254
then we got back, 
we took off and looked for 
him,

1372
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,690
and I think total 
I had five days in it.

1373
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:57,359
And was there 
a subsequent effort to find?

1374
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:01,463
We did go back the spring, 
um, we spent a full day

1375
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:05,768
with quite a few resources out 
and three different dog teams.

1376
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,571
Did your canines hit 
on any scent anywhere?

1377
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,339
BRYCE: 
I never had a hit.

1378
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,408
How odd is it 
not to pick up any scent?

1379
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,544
Very.

1380
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:16,912
As much ground as we covered

1381
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,249
in as many different 
wind patterns as we hit,

1382
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,851
you would think, 
you know, law of averages,

1383
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,787
you'd at least get 
a head turn out of it.

1384
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,655
Just somebody should 
at least tripped over him.

1385
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,457
The amount of people 
we've had out

1386
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,626
and we flew 
drones in the canyon.

1387
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,929
Well, three of the canyons, 
we flew drones in them.

1388
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,764
DAVID: 
Did you have any other 
kind of air support?

1389
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,399
BRYCE: 
We did. 
We had Civil Air.

1390
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,201
The last fall 
we had Civil Air in

1391
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:41,604
and they flew 
over forest for a couple days.

1392
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,406
Was there any evidence 
anywhere of animal predation?

1393
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,675
You know what I saw?

1394
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,577
We tracked one bear

1395
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,847
to see what he was, 
where he was gonna go.

1396
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,985
But the only other thing 
I noticed is we never had 
birds during that search.

1397
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,587
DAVID: 
And birds are 
an indicator of? 
BRYCE: 
A body.

1398
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,357
You can kind of 
hone in on to it.

1399
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,291
-BRYCE: 
Yeah. 
-By the birds.

1400
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,059
BRYCE: 
Yeah, 
and I mean, I run dogs.

1401
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,195
I'm a firm believer in dogs, 
but at the same time,

1402
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,663
if the birds already 
have eyes on him,

1403
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,031
that makes it a lot easier.

1404
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,500
And how odd was this search?

1405
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,870
Very. To not...

1406
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,740
Most people 
have kind of a pattern.

1407
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:21,810
I mean, if you're out hunting 
and you see an elk,

1408
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,346
you know, run across the road, 
you're probably gonna go

1409
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,781
find a spot 
to actually park,

1410
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,017
not just pull to the edge 
of the road and jump out.

1411
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,053
How difficult would it be 
for someone to be lost in 
there?

1412
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,858
If you really wanted out, 
everything around here,

1413
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,027
you just walk downhill 
until you find a road.

1414
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:39,928
DAVID: 
And you'll 
eventually hit a road? 
BRYCE: 
Eventually.

1415
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,730
You might have 
to cross private property.

1416
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,699
But if you're worried 
about dying 
in the middle of it,

1417
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:44,833
who cares?

1418
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,336
DAVID: So in talking 
to the search and rescue 
people,

1419
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,838
I asked them, I said so,

1420
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,807
"Was there anything odd 
about this?"

1421
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,276
-"The whole thing was odd." 
-Yeah.

1422
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,446
-So they said that the canines 
didn't pick up a scent. 
-No.

1423
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,516
They didn't see any tracks.

1424
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:02,951
-They never recovered 
any of his property. 
-Mm-mm.

1425
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:05,421
The weather 
changed the next day,

1426
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,656
and if Mark knew 
the weather was changing,

1427
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,591
-he wouldn't stay out there? 
-No.

1428
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:13,696
At what point 
did you tell yourself,

1429
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,965
"Hey, Mark 
may not be coming back"?

1430
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,970
After they got done searching,

1431
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:27,042
they just said, 
"You know, it's, 
it doesn't look good."

1432
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:31,680
DAVID: A lot of people 
said a lot of strange things 
about this case,

1433
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:35,617
and in your time 
with Mark out there,

1434
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,720
did you guys ever 
experience anything weird?

1435
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:41,023
-As far as-- 
-Anything weird?

1436
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:46,361
He was out hunting deer 
with a rifle,

1437
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,164
and he swore 
he saw a UFO out there.

1438
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,367
He was coming 
out from hunting,

1439
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:55,738
and he's, just happened 
to look up, and saw it,

1440
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,607
like he said, it was 
just like hovering, 
following him,

1441
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,709
and it freaked him out.

1442
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:04,146
And he tried to look at it 
through his binoculars,

1443
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,514
but it was getting dark.

1444
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,551
And it... So he, 
it scared him.

1445
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,353
What it looked like to him?

1446
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,856
He said 
it was just like a black...

1447
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,725
I believe it was just black, 
it was just hovering.

1448
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:19,094
-And it scared him? 
-Yeah.

1449
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,697
Because it was like 
it was following him out.

1450
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,599
Another odd question.

1451
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:25,601
Did Mark have a vasectomy?

1452
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,036
A vasectomy? No.

1453
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,638
DAVID: He didn't.

1454
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,673
Did he say how long 
he saw this thing?

1455
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:35,377
He said 
it was just following him,

1456
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,013
but minutes, 
like, disappeared.

1457
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:40,048
What did you think 
when you heard that?

1458
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,085
Kind of freaked me out 
because he was freaked out.

1459
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,921
-DAVID: And he was 
a pretty calm guy? 
-Mm-hmm.

1460
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,423
And would he 
be the kind of person 
ever make up stories like 
that?

1461
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:49,758
No.

1462
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:53,595
-So when you heard that from 
him believability a 100%? 
-Mm-hmm.

1463
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,465
That's crossed my mind, too.

1464
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,901
After he told me that story,

1465
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,837
maybe there was 
something out there.

1466
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,640
-So how many years 
were you guys together, 13? 
-Thirteen.

1467
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:08,377
And when he disappeared,

1468
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,647
how would you 
describe your relationship 
that previous week?

1469
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,283
Um, normal.

1470
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,484
-DAVID: Normal? 
-Yeah.

1471
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,052
And how did Mark 
get along with your kids?

1472
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:19,421
Fine.

1473
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:20,956
How did Marley take this?

1474
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:25,227
Oh, she's... 
having a rough time.

1475
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,800
And when you sit 
and you talk to Marley about 
it,

1476
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,535
what do you guys talk about?

1477
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,510
She's just sad 
that he's not here anymore.

1478
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,147
Yeah, she took it hard,

1479
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,615
and finally...

1480
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,552
she just kept asking me 
after he left,

1481
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,021
if he was coming back?

1482
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,526
It's hard for me 
to talk to her about it.

1483
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:04,633
So the million 
dollar question,

1484
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,168
what happened 
to Mark Strittmater?

1485
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,204
That same question 
can be applied

1486
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,241
to the thousands 
of other cases 
I've investigated,

1487
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,544
that follow 
the same profile points,

1488
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,279
we've discussed here.

1489
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,317
Families don't have answers.

1490
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,120
We move on to the next case,

1491
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:29,191
and it's something 
that follows me every day.

1492
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,930
I have great empathy 
for the families 
that are left behind.

1493
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,238
I've always been 
of the opinion

1494
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:47,643
that there aren't 
such a thing as coincidences.

1495
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,679
Just east of where 
Carl disappeared,

1496
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,081
there was another man, 
named Gustafson,

1497
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:57,119
and he was from Minnesota, 
another elk hunter,

1498
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,888
and he also disappeared 
and was never found.

1499
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,124
Now he was older. 
He was in his 70s,

1500
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:04,293
also in Medicine Bow.

1501
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:08,964
But those, those three cases 
were in geographical proximity 
to one another.

1502
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,303
Well, we're in the Medicine 
Bow National Forest,

1503
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:17,072
about 20 miles due east

1504
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,542
of where the Higdon 
and Strittmater case happened.

1505
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,744
Same forest, 
different location,

1506
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:27,249
right above 8,000, 
9,000 feet high up.

1507
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:31,453
And this is the location 
that Charles Gustafson

1508
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:36,191
a 72-year-old man 
from Minnesota, 
came out with his family.

1509
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:41,830
And on October 11th in 2006, 
split up from his family,

1510
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,765
and they decided 
to hunt different areas.

1511
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,668
Gustafson went 
off for the day.

1512
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,704
He didn't come 
back that night.

1513
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,006
His family members 
got concerned.

1514
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,242
He was carrying 
a Trailside GPS.

1515
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,644
He had a compass.

1516
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,212
He had food. He had water.

1517
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,614
The interesting part 
about this gentleman

1518
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,784
is he had survival training 
in the military.

1519
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:04,920
And so he knew how to,

1520
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,122
how to live out here 
in the wilderness.

1521
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:10,892
To think that he got out here 
and he got lost,

1522
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,894
kind of difficult 
to understand.

1523
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,366
My name is Jerry Colson.

1524
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:21,036
I'm the retired sheriff 
of Carbon County, Wyoming.

1525
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,639
And in 2006, 
when Charles Gustafson was 
here

1526
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:27,776
elk hunting 
in October of that year, 
he went missing.

1527
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,945
I was a sheriff at that time.

1528
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,347
So in the articles, it said 
that he was camped with,

1529
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:34,683
I think a nephew 
and some other relatives,

1530
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:39,721
-near Forest Road 111 and 129, 
is that kind of ring, right? 
-Correct.

1531
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,123
DAVID: 
I had also heard 
that he had been

1532
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,791
to this area 
many times in the past?

1533
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,126
Yeah, according 
to family members,

1534
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,428
they hunt this area 
pretty regular.

1535
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:49,865
And what kind of resources 
would you pull 
for something like this?

1536
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,534
Four-wheel drive 
and searchers on foot,

1537
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:55,137
requested a helicopter 
out of Warren Air Force Base

1538
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,472
in Cheyenne, 
military helicopter.

1539
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,174
And we would 
use Civil Air Patrol.

1540
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,410
So we go, you 
know, air search.

1541
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:05,347
And we eventually 
had searchers 
on horseback too.

1542
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,050
Brought in some canines, um,

1543
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,985
both cadaver and search dogs.

1544
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,820
As the time went on, 
we went with cadaver.

1545
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,723
Did any dog 
pick up a scent trail?

1546
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:17,392
No, nothing 
that led to Mr. Gustafson.

1547
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,595
-You searched for what? 
A week? 
-About six days.

1548
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:22,064
I had to call it off 
about the sixth day

1549
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:22,931
because of the weather 
coming in.

1550
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,633
The helicopters 
were there until

1551
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,034
it started snowing 
and they had to go.

1552
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,637
The unusual nature 
of being lost in the woods

1553
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,273
and not found, 
is that unusual?

1554
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,875
It's not unusual for people 
to become lost in the woods.

1555
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:36,111
It is unusual 
and not commonplace

1556
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,613
for us not to find 
within a day or two.

1557
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:44,052
People who watch this will 
say, "Oh, you know, maybe this 
was a case of animal 
predation."

1558
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:45,987
What would you say to that?

1559
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,355
I mean, we have bears.

1560
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,324
I can tell you 
the whole time I was sheriff

1561
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:52,060
and I worked at sheriff's 
office for 39 years,

1562
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:55,163
I never remember anybody 
being attacked by a bear.

1563
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:59,568
How long was it before anybody 
found anything related to him?

1564
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,435
There were some fishermen

1565
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,171
down there 
in Rock Creek canyon,

1566
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,473
and they were 
just walking along,

1567
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,041
with everyone else saying, 
"Look over there,"

1568
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,443
and there's this rifle 
sitting in the fork of a tree,

1569
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:11,346
leaning in the fork 
of a tree right by the creek.

1570
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:12,814
So they picked it up 
and brought it out

1571
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:14,349
and turned it over 
and we got it

1572
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,751
and confirmed to the family 
it was his rifle.

1573
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:19,154
Was anything else found 
in that immediate area?

1574
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,055
Myself and some 
other searchers,

1575
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,023
we went down 
to the right of that area

1576
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,758
where everything was found.

1577
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:28,363
I actually sat down on the 
side of the hill there by the 
creek.

1578
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:29,965
I looked over 
at about ten-foot from me,

1579
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:31,733
here's this fanny pack.

1580
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:33,235
It had a water bottle, 
I remember that.

1581
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,937
So it turned out 
to be Charlie's fanny pack.

1582
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,939
So was any 
of his clothing or shoes

1583
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:39,374
-or any of that found? 
-Never. Nothing.

1584
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:42,410
Other than 
his fanny pack and rifle. 
That's all that's been found.

1585
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:51,219
So we have 
Charles' disappearance 
in northern Medicine Bow.

1586
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,189
We have 
the Strittmater disappearance,

1587
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:57,225
just southwest of where 
Charles disappeared.

1588
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,463
We also have 
the Higdon disappearance.

1589
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:06,268
On the northwest sector 
of Cheyenne 
is Warren Air Force Base.

1590
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,905
And this is the location 
that did the air support

1591
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:13,108
on the disappearances 
we marked here.

1592
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:16,077
Surprisingly, 
I found some documents

1593
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:20,348
about UFOs being observed

1594
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:24,352
by on-duty 
Air Force personnel at Warren.

1595
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,026
All three men 
have German heritage.

1596
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:33,428
All three men, elk hunters.

1597
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:37,399
I had to ask myself, 
are there other hunters

1598
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:41,436
missing from this region 
that matched that profile?

1599
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:45,006
Are there any hunters 
that have gone 
missing in recent times,

1600
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,043
that kind of match the profile 
of these other guys?

1601
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:50,245
Yeah, a guy named Terry Meador

1602
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:52,214
who was a teacher 
here in Rock Springs,

1603
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:54,683
I actually knew him, 
and he was a teacher

1604
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,051
when I was in high school.

1605
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,686
And he came up missing

1606
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:00,222
when he had gone out 
to go hunting.

1607
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:01,957
DAVID: And the area 
that he was in,

1608
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,992
can you kind of 
explain it to us?

1609
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,561
Well, it's very typical 
of southwest Wyoming.

1610
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,364
It's sagebrush, prairie.

1611
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:13,301
Uh, it's what we call 
high desert, isolated.

1612
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,470
-DAVID: 
Not a lot of cover? 
-No.

1613
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,239
So where could he go?

1614
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,407
He'd have to 
crawl into a hole.

1615
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,309
-DAVID: 
And there are not 
a lot of holes there? 
-No.

1616
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:24,412
-Not a lot of caves. 
-I mean, it's open desert.

1617
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,716
Anything out there 
in the middle of the desert 
that could hurt him?

1618
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:30,785
On occasion 
we've had a wolf or two.

1619
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:35,257
I can't think of 
any large predatory animals 
that would be able to,

1620
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,326
you know, take a human being 
and drag them off somewhere.

1621
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,195
What would be 
your thinking on that?

1622
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,429
I suppose we could say that

1623
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,531
there's a possibility 
he was abducted.

1624
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,201
Uh, but 
there's no evidence of that.

1625
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,969
All we know 
is that he was there

1626
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,571
and then 
he's not there anymore.

1627
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:52,540
DAVID: 
This is in the 
middle-of-nowhere desert.

1628
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,844
And his truck 
was stuck in a ditch.

1629
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:58,179
And they searched for a week 
and they never found him.

1630
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:04,452
Do you see any, 
any convening of the facts,

1631
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:08,290
any assimilation 
that you could make 
between all of these guys?

1632
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,091
One of the big similarities, 
of course is

1633
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,960
that they're all by themselves

1634
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,162
and they're all elk hunting.

1635
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,830
With the exception 
of Mr. Meador,

1636
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:17,465
they're all about 
the same age.

1637
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:22,270
In your time as monitoring 
MUFON activity in Wyoming,

1638
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:25,006
have you ever heard 
of anything similar to this?

1639
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,309
We have the cases 
involving Pat McGuire,

1640
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:32,747
who owned a ranch over 
in the eastern part of 
Wyoming,

1641
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:38,453
and he had 
a series of incidents I guess 
you could say involving UFOs

1642
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:41,056
and I was fortunate enough 
to be able to sit in

1643
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:44,125
on one of the regressive 
hypnosis sessions.

1644
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,696
And he had some experiences.

1645
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,597
And he was allegedly told

1646
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:54,569
by a race of alien beings 
that he was to build a well,

1647
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:59,908
to dig a well on this location 
in or near Wheatland, Wyoming.

1648
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,609
He took that very seriously.

1649
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,946
He actually went out 
and bought himself a tank

1650
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,414
and he got the motor off it

1651
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,917
to pump the water 
out of this well.

1652
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,387
But he had geologists, 
and all these other folks 
tell him that he was crazy

1653
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:15,023
for wanting to put the well 
where he wanted to put it,

1654
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,792
because it was 
just a solid slab of rock.

1655
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,061
And there was no way 
he was ever 
gonna get any water.

1656
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,397
But he insisted 
that the aliens

1657
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,132
had told him 
that there was water there

1658
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:26,167
and by God, 
he was gonna dig that well.

1659
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,969
-And he did. 
-Boy.

1660
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:31,806
DAVID: 
And you just said 
something that is huge to me.

1661
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,577
So in the United States, 
we have 64 geographical 
clusters

1662
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:38,313
of missing people 
that fit our profile points.

1663
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,515
As unusual as it sounds,

1664
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:43,518
right down the middle 
of the United States,

1665
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:47,155
there is an area where 
there are no disappearances.

1666
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:52,093
Several months ago, 
I got an email from somebody 
who worked for the government.

1667
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:56,731
And he said, 
"Dave, that area of the U.S.

1668
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,668
"corresponds to a area,

1669
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:04,439
"which has been described 
by the U.S. Geological Survey,

1670
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:08,276
"as an underground water area.

1671
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:10,979
"It's called 
the Ogallala Aquifer."

1672
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:16,418
He says, "You should see 
if it corresponds 
with your profile now."

1673
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:21,756
What we did is we overlay that 
on top of our cluster map.

1674
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:26,561
It's almost a near match, 
which is interesting.

1675
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:32,233
Because of my background 
with MUFON and UFOs,

1676
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:36,638
I also know about 
underwater submerged objects.

1677
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,810
And those are 
essentially just UFOs 
that have gone to water.

1678
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,647
And if there was a way

1679
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:50,285
to keep yourself hidden,

1680
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:53,655
yet make yourself 
apparent at certain times,

1681
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:59,360
it would be by using the 
aquifer in going out through 
Wyoming.

1682
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:02,664
And when you think about 
the McGuire incident,

1683
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:05,467
and the ability of the UFOs 
to go through the aquifer

1684
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,269
and up out of his well 
if they watered

1685
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,339
and then their proximity 
in southwest Wyoming

1686
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:13,675
to all the incidents 
we've talked about,

1687
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:18,079
again it's another 
one of those coincidence

1688
01:25:18,112 --> 01:25:19,347
that you can't ignore.

1689
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,253
The Ogallala Aquifer, 
that covers

1690
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:28,957
almost the exact area 
where nobody is missing!

1691
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,459
And I put it 
in the back of my mind. 
I didn't think much about it.

1692
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:35,697
But, damn, you saying 
that this person digs a well

1693
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,032
and it's an offshoot 
from the Ogallala

1694
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:39,367
and the aliens 
told him to do it.

1695
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,935
-Yeah. 
-That's weird.

1696
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,104
Now what's really weird 
is they tell him to do it

1697
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:45,507
and all the geologists 
and all those guys

1698
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,208
tell him 
that there's nothing there.

1699
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,344
He's crazy for doing, 
and he digs the well anyway

1700
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:52,046
and taps in and 
finds the water.

1701
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,549
So the crazy guy was right.

1702
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:57,452
Now, did the aliens 
tell him to dig the well?

1703
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:59,220
I don't know, Pat said...

1704
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,290
He certainly believe 
that the aliens 
told him to dig the well.

1705
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:06,361
The reason 
for the digging of the well

1706
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:09,364
was so that in the event

1707
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:12,567
that there was 
a a global cataclysm,

1708
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,538
that there would be 
a fresh source of water 
for the inhabitants

1709
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:19,507
of that location 
when it took place.

1710
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,676
DAVID: 
Let's put all of this 
into perspective.

1711
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:24,379
If we plot the locations 
of the Wyoming cluster

1712
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,980
of missing hunters on a map,

1713
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:29,083
this coincides with the spread

1714
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:32,353
of chronic wasting disease 
throughout southeast Wyoming.

1715
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:35,623
Chronic wasting disease 
is decimating

1716
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:38,826
the elk and deer populations 
in this region.

1717
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,496
All of the missing 
and abducted men 
were elk hunters,

1718
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,932
and all of them 
disappeared in close proximity

1719
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:47,702
to Warren Air Force Base, 
where numerous UFO sightings

1720
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:51,606
have incredibly documented 
by government officials.

1721
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:55,410
We know from the Higdon 
and the elk abduction cases

1722
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,312
that these beings, 
whoever they are,

1723
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,647
are interested 
in North American elk.

1724
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,016
We can hypothesize 
that perhaps these beings

1725
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,118
are monitoring 
our elk population

1726
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:09,457
for what is possibly 
the worst wildlife disaster 
in North America.

1727
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:13,027
Just northeast of this cluster 
is Pat McGuire's ranch,

1728
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:16,698
where the beings told him 
to dig a well for water,

1729
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:20,635
that miraculously was fed 
by the Ogallala Aquifer.

1730
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:23,771
There are no 
clusters of missing 
around this property.

1731
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,773
Nor are there 
clusters of missing

1732
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,875
in the main body 
of the aquifer.

1733
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:32,614
All the victims 
in this incident 
were elk hunting.

1734
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:34,949
Each was alone.

1735
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:39,187
Two of the hunters in Wyoming 
observed a UFO.

1736
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,656
Canines could never 
pick up a scent.

1737
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:45,593
A UFO in Washington 
was observed taking an elk.

1738
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:49,664
Carl Higdon observed elk 
on a UFO.

1739
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,967
Only one victim 
was ever found.

1740
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,703
That was Carl Higdon 
who believed he was returned

1741
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,672
because he had a vasectomy.

1742
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:01,843
Let's not forget 
the first missing person case.

1743
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:05,146
Ray Salmen from Harrison Lake, 
British Columbia.

1744
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:06,648
Ray and his wife had seen UFOs

1745
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,750
in the British Columbia forest 
in the past.

1746
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,752
Ray was a hunter.

1747
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,286
He was German.

1748
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,223
He was camped 
adjacent to a lake.

1749
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:17,392
Canines never 
picked up a scent.

1750
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:20,428
His clothes and rifle 
were found on a beach.

1751
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,930
He disappeared, 
was never found.

1752
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:27,635
It's another incident 
that is an exact match 
to the Wyoming cases.

1753
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:34,142
As incredible as it sounds, 
you have to start wondering 
what is happening here.

1754
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:35,543
There's nowhere to turn

1755
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,513
and I don't think 
we left many stones unturned.

1756
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:42,517
DAVID: 
Frustration and fear 
turns to anger, 
anger to loss of hope.

1757
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,553
As an investigator, 
you do your due diligence.

1758
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,356
If you can't provide closure 
in a traditional sense,

1759
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:49,957
and the incredible 
or paranormal

1760
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,360
may be tied 
to the disappearance,

1761
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:53,995
how do you explain 
that to a grieving family

1762
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,097
that we might be 
dealing with something

1763
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:59,801
that is just beyond 
the normal 
and the extreme

1764
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:02,036
that leads 
to unknown consequences?

1765
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,140
It puts me 
in a difficult situation.

1766
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,109
Puts you 
in a difficult situation.

1767
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:11,612
When you have families 
that are missing a loved one,

1768
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:14,549
-I can't go tell them this. 
-Exactly. Exactly.

1769
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,651
-Who's gonna believe me? 
-Yeah.

1770
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:22,190
Um, yeah, you can't 
because it's... it's 
unprovable.

1771
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:25,660
It's a purely 
in a physical world,

1772
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:28,463
it's just not provable.

1773
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:29,997
DAVID: 
Yet eyewitnesses' reports

1774
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,066
of unexplained events 
in the skies

1775
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,001
are increasing exponentially.

1776
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,804
DAVID: 
How many calls 
do you think you get a year?

1777
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:42,810
Uh, I would say between 
30 and 100 per day, typically.

1778
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,780
So saying rough around figures

1779
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:49,484
somewhere between 
20,000 and 30,000 calls a 
year.

1780
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:50,952
DAVID: 
And the conviction 
and credibility

1781
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,587
of those 
who have witnessed them

1782
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,056
is unnerving, to 
say the least.

1783
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:58,392
Believe it or not, 
I just know what I saw.

1784
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:01,763
A lot of truths 
are really experiential.

1785
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:04,332
DAVID: 
Elk hunters 
of German heritage 
are being taken

1786
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:07,401
in specific regions 
in North America.

1787
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:10,738
Witnesses corroborate 
bizarre occurrences in the 
sky,

1788
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,508
directly related 
to these incidents.

1789
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:17,078
What's left are the words 
of those who have lost so much

1790
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:19,614
and those who returned 
to share their stories.
